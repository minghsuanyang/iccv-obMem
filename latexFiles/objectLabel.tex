In the previous sections, we showed that simple features have little predictive power over object memorability and there exists a weak [JOSH: this might be too strong of a claim] relationship between visual saliency and object memorability. In this section, we show that object memorability is heavily influenced by it's category and investigate the possible reasons why.

\subsubsection{Why are some objects not memorable within a class?}
