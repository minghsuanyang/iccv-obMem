Among the many reasons why an image might be remembered by a viewer, we investigate first the role of various image based and semantic properties of the images: color, simple
image features, object statistics, object semantics, scene semantics, and high-level attributes. First, we will show that some of the aspects that observers believe contribute to make
an image more memorable do not predict which images are memorable.
