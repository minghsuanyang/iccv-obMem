In this section, we aim to better understand object memorability and the factors that make an object more memorable or forgettable to humans. We first investigate the role that simple color features play in determining object memorability. 

\subsection{Can simple color features explain object memorability?}

\subsection{What is the relationship between visual saliency and object memorability?}

\input{fixation}

\subsection{What is the relationship between object memorability and object categories?}

\input{objectLabel}

\subsection{What is the relationship between object and image memorability?}
