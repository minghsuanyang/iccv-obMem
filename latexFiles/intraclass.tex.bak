As demonstrated above, some object classes like animal, person, vehicle are more memorable than others. However, not all objects in a class are equally memorable. The examples in figure \ref{fig:qualLabel} show the most memorable and least memorable objects for each object class. A common property between these objects is that the least memorable objects within each object class tends to be occluded and obstructed by other objects. What other possible factors could influence the memorability of an object within a class? Among various possible factors, we explored how object memorability within a particular class is influenced by a) number of objects and b) presence of another object class.

\textbf{Number of objects:} We first tested how the memorability of each object class is affected by the number of objects inside an image. We took in all images that had at least 'n' objects (where $1 <= n <= 10$) inside them and computed the average memorability of each object class. Figure \ref{fig:obLabelChange} shows the change in average memorability of the different object classes with respect to the increase in number of objects in an image. Results from this figure show that the number of objects present in an image is an important factor in determining memorability especially for classes like animal and vehicle. As the number of objects in an image increase, the memorability of animal and vehicle classes decreases sharply. This could mean that with an increase in number of objects, viewers cannot concentrate on a single object in an image and have a difficulty remembering objects in those images. Interestingly, the memorability of the person class does not change significantly with an increase in number of objects. This suggests that humans tend to remember people even in highly cluttered images.

\textbf{Inter-class memorability:} How does the presence of a particular object class influence the memorability of another object class? For each possible pair of object categories, we took all images that contained at least one object from both the categories and computed the change in the average memorability scores for the two object categories. Figure \ref{fig:obLabelPair} captures the relationship between different pairs of object categories and shows how the memorability of each object class is affected in the presence of other object classes. Firstly, the memorability of low memorable classes i.e. nature, furniture, device, and building is not effected greatly in the presence of other object categories and their memorability tends to be low throughout. The memorability of the animal class remains close to it's average memorability in presence of most classes, but it drops significantly in the presence of vehicle and person class. The memorability of person class also remains close to it's average memorability score and tends to be unaffected by the presence of most object categories. However, the memorability of person does go lower in the presence of vehicle and building classes. This could be due to the fact that persons in images containing vehicles or buildings are usually zoomed out and are usually smaller in size (also illustrated in figure \ref{fig:qualInterClass}). The memorability of vehicle class is strongly affected by the presence of other object categories. In particular, it's memorability drops significantly in presence of person and animal classes. Taken together, when an animal, vehicle or a person are present in the same image, the memorability for all these object classes usually goes down. However, this change in memorability is different for all these classes which leads to interesting results. When a vehicle or an animal is present alongside a person, the person is generally more memorable. When a vehicle and an animal is present in the same image, even though the memorability of both these classes drops significantly, the animal is generally more memorable than the vehicle. We also show examples of such inter-class memorability effects in Figure \ref{fig:qualInterClass}.
