As demonstrated above, some object classes like animal, person, vehicle are more than others either due to their intrinsic property or external factors like occlusion, foreground/background etc. However, not all objects in a class are equally memorable. The examples in figure \ref{fig:qualLabel} show the most memorable and least memorable objects for each object class. A common property between these objects is that the least memorable objects within each object class tend to be occluded and obstructed by other objects. What other possible factors could influence the memorability of an object within a class?

\input{qualFigure}

\textbf{Relationship with number of objects in an image:} We first tested how the memorability of each object class is affected by the number of objects inside an image. We took in all images that had at least 'n' objects (where $1 <= n <= 10$) inside them and computed the average memorability of each object class. Figure \ref{fig:obLabelChange} shows the change in average memorability of the different object classes with respect to the increase in number of objects in an image. This figure shows that the number of objects present in an image is an important factor that results in the variation in the memorability of objects within a class. As the number of objects in an image increase, the memorability of the object classes decreases. In particular, the memorability of objects belonging to highly memorable classes like animal, person, and vehicle decreases significantly with the increase in number of objects in an image. Intuitively, this could mean that with an increase in number of objects, humans cannot concentrate on a single object in an image and have a difficulty remembering objects in those images. Thus, if a person, animal or vehicle is present in a highly cluttered image, humans can not remember those objects very well.

\textbf{Relationship of inter-class memorability:} While the previous analysis sheds light on how the memorability of an object class is effected by factors such as occlusion, and number of objects in an image, how does the presence of a particular object class effect the memorability of another object class? To investigate this, for each possible pair of object categories we took all images that contained at least one object from both the categories and computed the average memorability scores for the two object categories. This way we were able to capture the relationship between pairs of object categories and how their presence effects their respective memorability scores. Figure \ref{fig:obLabelPair} plots these results and for each object class, shows how it's memorability is effected in the presence of other object classes. The red mark on each line shows the over all average memorability of that class. Firstly, the memorability of low memorable classes i.e. nature, furniture, device, and building is not effected a lot in the presence of other object categories and their memorability tends to be low throughout. The memorability of person class also remains close to it's average memorability score and tends to be unaffected by the presence of most object categories. However, the memorability of person does get effected in the presence of buildings as the average memorability of person class drops below $0.4$ for images containing both persons and buildings. This could be due to the fact that there exists images wherein the building is quite large and the persons in those images are usually smaller or less significant in contrast to the building (also illustrated in figure \ref{fig:qualInterClass}). The memorability of the animal class remains close to it's average memorability in presence of most classes, however it drops significantly to below $0.4$ in presence of the person class (also shown in figure \ref{fig:qualInterClass}). The memorability of vehicle class is strongly affected by the presence of other object categories. In particular, it's memorability drops significantly in presence of person and animal classes also shown in figure \ref{fig:qualInterClass}.

Taken together, the results from this section show that the memorability an object within a particular class is greatly effected by occlusion, number of objects present in an image and presence of other object classes in the image.
