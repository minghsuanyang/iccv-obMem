In the previous sections, we showed that simple features have little predictive power over object memorability and there exists a weak relationship between visual saliency and object memorability. In this section, we show that object memorability is heavily influenced by it's category and investigate the possible reasons behind the same. 

\subsubsection{Are some object classes more memorable than others?}

Our dataset contains $3414$ object segmentations from the Pascal-S dataset. For this analysis, we first assigned three in-house annotators the task of assigning class labels to each object segmentation in our dataset. The annotators were given the original image (for reference) and the object segmentation and asked to assign $1$ category to the segment out of $7$ possible categories: animal, building, device, furniture, nature, person, vehicle. We choose these $7$ categories for their high-level nature and a wide range of classes could be covered under these categories.
