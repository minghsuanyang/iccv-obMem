In the previous sections, we showed that simple features have little predictive power over object memorability and explored the relationship between visual saliency and object memorability. In this section, we explore how the category of an object influences the probability that the object will be remembered. 

\subsubsection{Are some object classes more memorable than others?}

\input{interclass}

\subsubsection{Why are some objects not memorable within a class?}
