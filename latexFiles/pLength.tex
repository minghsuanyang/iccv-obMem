For ICCV 2015, the rules about paper length have changed, so please
read this section carefully. Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than eight pages in length. One additional page
containing {\em only} cited references is allowed, for a total maximal
length of nine pages.


Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.  This includes papers
where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly
altered from those laid down by this style guide.  Note that this
\LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for
supervised revisions of manuscripts.  The reviewing process cannot determine
the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is
reviewed in eleven.
