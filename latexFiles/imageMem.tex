Now that we know what objects people remember and the factor that influence their memorability, how does the memorability of objects effect the overall image memorability? In particular, if an image is highly memorable, what happens to memorability of objects inside those images (and vice versa)? To shed light on the relationship between image memorability and object memorability, we conducted another large-scale experiment on Amazon Mechanical turk for the images in our dataset to gather their respective image memorability scores. For this experiment, we followed the exact paradigm as the memory game experiment proposed in \cite{isola11}. [add details about the fillers, add details about the experiment including number of workers, number of times each image was viewed by workers and explain the consistency analysis]

For each image, we computed the maximum object memorability and correlated that with the image memorability scores. We found that the correlation was moderately high ($\rho-0.4$) which suggests that the memorability of the most highly memorable object in the image plays an important role in determining the image memorability. To investigate further, we performed the same analysis by taking the topmost $100$ memorable images and the bottommost $100$ memorable images from the dataset. The correlation between maximum object memorability and image memorability for these images increased significantly ($\rho=0.62$) which shows that maximum object memorability serves as a strong features in predicting if an image is highly memorable or not. Images that are highly memorable contain at least one highly memorable object and images with low memorability usually do not contain a single highly memorable object [refer to qual figure].

We explored this further by studying how this correlation changes when the most memorable object belongs to different classes (Table \ref{tab:tableMem}).
